# AI Summary Generator

This repository contains a method for generating AI summaries of large non-fiction texts by breaking them down into manageable parts and summarizing each part individually. This process allows for the distillation of lengthy documents into concise and digestible summaries.

## How it Works

1. **Input**: The process starts with a non-fiction text file as the input.

2. **Tokenization & Chunking**: The text file is tokenized and chunked to break it down into manageable pieces. This step is crucial for processing large texts efficiently.

3. **Summary Generation**: Each chunk of the text is processed by GPT-4, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate a summary. GPT-4 utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to produce coherent and informative summaries.

4. **Storage**: The summaries generated for each chunk are stored. This storage mechanism allows for easy retrieval and aggregation of the generated summaries.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Python is used for the initial processing of the text file and handling the overall workflow.
- GPT-4: GPT-4 is employed for the AI-driven summarization part. It leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to generate high-quality summaries.

## Usage
